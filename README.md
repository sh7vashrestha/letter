# A Letter to Nayanti 💌

This is a small handcrafted webpage — a digital letter written with love, warmth, and creativity for Nayanti.

## 🌸 About

The page features:

- A beautiful envelope opening animation.
- A personal letter styled with elegant fonts and paper textures.
- Subtle handwritten-like animations for a personal touch.
- Fully responsive design for both desktop and mobile.

It was created using:

- Pure HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.
- Google Fonts: `Dancing Script`, `Kalam`, and `Caveat` for a handwritten feel.
- Carefully designed custom gradients and shadows to mimic a vintage letter on a wooden desk.
